## Submission of Work to AIAP

### Questions Attempted

Questions 2 and 3 were attempted.

### Time Allocation

I spent about equal amount of time per question. 

For Question 2, some time was spent looking through the data, and just thinking about what models to use. Approximately 2 hours were spent on actual produced exploratory data analysis graphs.

A small amount of additional time was then spent coding up the models, after some careful thought about which models might be most appropriate.

For Question 3, most of the time was spent on the matrix calculations by hand. 

### Submission Information

Question 2 was done in R. The R script is also attached. The completed markdown file with supporting figures has been uploaded to github.com/ooichinchun/SindianRealEstate for ease of reference.

Question 3 was done on paper. The completed work has been scanned and attached as individual pdfs.
